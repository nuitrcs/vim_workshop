Materials for git workshops taught by Northwestern IT Research Computing

# Setup

On Mac and Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed and can be
accessed via Mac Terminal and Linux Shell.

For this workshop we recommend **Windows** users to download Git Bash as
it provides a basic we use Vim from Unix Shell. Git Bash is included in
Git for Windows. If you do not already have Git installed for your Windows,
you can download an installer at [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

During **Windows** installation, you can use the default options presented except
for **_Adjusting your PATH environment_** step. For this step, select "**_Use
Git from Git Bash only_**" option so your environment variables will not
be modified.
